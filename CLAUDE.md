### Local setup dependencies

The app requires two external services running before `npm run dev` will work end-to-end:
- **Ollama** running locally/remotely (for both chat completion and embeddings models).
- **Supabase** project with `pgvector` enabled — run the SQL in `supabaseScripts.txt` once against the project to create the `documents` table/`match_documents` RPC, the `users` table with password hashing trigger, `verify_password` RPC, and `delete_documents_by_user` RPC. A `document_store` storage bucket is also expected (used by `src/app/api/document/route.ts`).

Env vars (see `env.example`): `SUPABASE_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `OLLAMA_LLM_BASE_URL`, `OLLAMA_LLM_MODEL`, `OLLAMA_EMBEDDINGS_BASE_URL`, `OLLAMA_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL`. Read centrally through `src/app/utils/env.ts` — always add new env vars there rather than calling `process.env` directly elsewhere.

**Optional:** `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_BASEURL` — when present, every `/api/chat` request is traced via LangFuse (latency, token counts, prompt/completion per chain node). The app runs normally without them. Tracing uses the OpenTelemetry-based `@langfuse/langchain` + `@langfuse/otel` SDK (v5), not the legacy `langfuse-langchain` package — that legacy package only supports LangChain 0.3.x and is incompatible with this project's `@langchain/core` v1.x stack.

## Architecture

This is a Next.js (App Router) RAG chat app: a PDF is uploaded, chunked and embedded into Supabase/pgvector, and a chat interface answers questions grounded in the retrieved chunks, streamed back to the client.

### Request flow for chat (`/api/chat`)

`src/app/api/chat/route.ts` reads an optional `ragMode` field off the request body and dispatches to `buildRagChain(mode, filter)` from `src/app/lib/rag-strategies/index.ts` — a registry (`RAG_STRATEGIES`) mapping a `RagMode` string to a strategy builder `(filter) => RunnableSequence`, exactly as before citations existed. Unknown/missing modes fall back to `DEFAULT_RAG_MODE` (`"condense"`). The chosen mode is also added to the LangFuse trace tags (`rag-mode:<mode>`) so traces can be filtered/compared per strategy.

Strategies currently registered in `src/app/lib/rag-strategies/` are plain LangChain runnable compositions — no hand-rolled async orchestration:
- **`condense`** (default, `condense.ts`) — three-stage `RunnableSequence`: (1) `standaloneTemplate` + `llm` rewrites question+history into a standalone question, handling follow-up/pronoun references; (2) the standalone question flows through `retrieveAndBuildContext(filter)` (`rag-strategies/retrieval.ts`), a `RunnableLambda` that retrieves via `retriever(filter)` and calls `buildContext` (`src/app/utils/helpers.ts`) to number each chunk as `[Source N | Page P]`, returning `{context, sources}`; (3) `answerTemplate` + `llm` streams the final answer from `{context, question, history}`, instructed to cite chunks inline as `[Source N]`.
- **`naive`** (`naive.ts`) — control-group baseline: embeds the raw question directly with no condensing/rewriting, otherwise the same retrieve → `buildContext` → answer shape.
- **`multi-query`** (`multi-query.ts`) — `multiQueryTemplate` + `llm` generates 4 alternative phrasings of the question (history-aware so pronouns resolve), then `retrieveManyAndBuildContext(filter)` (`retrieval.ts`) fans the retriever out over `[original, ...phrasings]` via `.batch()`, dedupes the unioned chunks by `pageContent`, and builds citation context. Same answer stage as the others.
- **`hyde`** (`hyde.ts`) — HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings): structurally identical to `condense`, but the first stage (`hydeTemplate` + `llm`) drafts a short *hypothetical answer passage* (history-aware) and embeds that for retrieval instead of a rewritten question — answer-shaped text lands closer to document chunks in embedding space than question-shaped text does. The draft is retrieval-only; the user-visible answer is still generated from retrieved context.
- **`hybrid`** (`hybrid.ts`) — hybrid keyword + vector search: the raw question (no rewriting, so exact terms/acronyms survive) goes through `hybridRetrieveAndBuildContext(filter)` (`retrieval.ts`) → `hybridSearcher` (`supabase.ts`), which embeds the query and calls the `hybrid_search` RPC directly — full-text (`tsvector`/GIN) and vector rankings fused in-database via reciprocal rank fusion. Bypasses `SupabaseVectorStore` because that class only sends the embedding, and hybrid needs the query *text* too. **Requires `supabaseScripts.txt` STEP 9 to have been run** — without it the RPC doesn't exist and this mode errors at query time.
- **`rerank`** (`rerank.ts`) — LLM-based re-ranking: retrieves on the raw question via `rerankRetrieveAndBuildContext(filter)` (`retrieval.ts`), over-fetching 20 candidates by cosine similarity (`retriever(filter, k)` now takes an optional `k`, passed straight to `VectorStore.asRetriever`), scores each candidate's relevance to the question with one `llm` call apiece (`rerankTemplate`, 0–1 score), sorts, and keeps the top 4. Ollama has no cross-encoder model, so this is prompt-based scoring rather than a real reranker — 20 extra LLM calls per query, so noticeably slower/costlier than the other modes; that tradeoff is the point of comparing it in LangFuse.

`retrieveAndBuildContext` / `retrieveManyAndBuildContext` (shared by the strategies — the multi-query variant deliberately carries the **same** `runName` `"retrieveAndBuildContext"` so the route's `sources` extraction is strategy-agnostic) and the final answer LLM call are each given an explicit `runName` (`"retrieveAndBuildContext"` and `"answerLLM"`) via `.withConfig({runName})`. This is purely so `/api/chat` can pick their events out of `.streamEvents()` by name — it has no effect on chain behavior.

`src/app/lib/rag-strategies/modes.ts` holds the `RagMode` type and UI labels and has **no LangChain/LLM imports** so it can be safely imported from client components (see `src/app/home/page.tsx`'s mode picker) — everything else in that folder is server-only.

Prompt text lives in `src/app/lib/prompts.ts` — edit these templates to change model behavior/tone, not the runnable wiring. Add a new RAG technique by adding a strategy file (a `RunnableSequence` factory, typically built around `retrieveAndBuildContext`) + registering it in both `rag-strategies/index.ts` (`RAG_STRATEGIES`) and `rag-strategies/modes.ts` (`RAG_MODES`, for the UI picker).

### Streaming protocol and source citations

`/api/chat` calls `chain.streamEvents(input, {version: "v2", callbacks})` rather than `chain.stream()`, and responds with `Content-Type: text/event-stream` (SSE) rather than raw text — this is what lets the response carry a structured `sources` payload alongside the answer tokens without changing the strategy chains into anything other than plain runnables. The route filters the raw LangChain event stream down to four SSE event types: one `sources` event (the `on_chain_end` output of the `retrieveAndBuildContext` step — a JSON array of `{id, pageNumber}`, emitted before any tokens because that step finishes before the answer LLM starts generating), one `token` event per `on_chat_model_stream` chunk from the step named `answerLLM` (`{text: "..."}`), `stage` events (see below), then a terminal `done` (or `error`) event. The frontend (`src/app/home/page.tsx`) hand-parses this over a raw `fetch` + `ReadableStream` reader (splitting on blank lines) rather than using `EventSource`, because `EventSource` can't send the POST body/custom headers this route needs.

### Pipeline visualizer (`stage` SSE events)

Every strategy names its internal sub-steps via `.withConfig({runName})` (not just the shared `retrieveAndBuildContext`/`answerLLM` pair) — e.g. `condense.ts`'s standalone-question rewrite is named `standaloneQuestion`, `multi-query.ts`'s rephrasing step is `generatePhrasings`, `hyde.ts`'s draft is `hydeDraft`, and `retrieval.ts`'s retriever/dedupe/rerank sub-steps are named `vectorRetrieve`/`vectorRetrieveMany`/`dedupeCandidates`/`hybridSearch`/`overFetchCandidates`/`scoreCandidates`. `src/app/lib/rag-strategies/pipeline-metadata.ts` (client-safe, like `modes.ts`) declares, per `RagMode`, the ordered list of these stage ids plus newbie-facing `label`/`what`/`why` text — this is the single source of truth both the backend and frontend key off of. `/api/chat/route.ts` builds a `STAGE_IDS` set from it and, independently of the `sources`/`token` emission, emits one `stage` SSE event per `on_*_start`/`on_*_end` LangChain event whose `event.name` is a known stage id (matched generically by event-type suffix since retriever/chat-model/chain runnables emit different `on_*` prefixes for the same concept) — `{stageId, status: "start"|"end", data?}`, where `data` (on `end` only) is `{input, output, llm?}`: `input`/`output` are small display-shaped payloads from `shapeStageInput()`/`shapeStageData()` (the literal text/query sent into and the doc/chunk previews, phrasings list, or rerank score table that came out), and `llm` (only for `standaloneQuestion`/`generatePhrasings`/`hydeDraft`/`answerLLM`) is `{prompt, completion}` — the literal rendered prompt text and raw completion, reconstructed from the nested `on_chat_model_end` event's `{messages}` input. The three query-transformation stages wrap their inner LLM call in a *second*, distinctly-named runnable (`standaloneQuestionLLM`/`generatePhrasingsLLM`/`hydeDraftLLM` — see `LLM_STAGE_RUNNAMES` in `route.ts`) purely so that inner call's own start/end events don't collide with the outer stage's own same-named start/end events; `answerLLM` needs no such split since it *is* the chat-model call directly (no wrapping sequence). Note: LangChain JS's `StreamEvent` type has no `parent_ids` field (unlike the Python version), so nested events can only be attributed to a parent stage by giving them distinct names — don't assume run-id/parent-id correlation is available if extending this further. `rerank.ts`'s 20 per-candidate scoring calls (`scoreRelevance` in `retrieval.ts`) are a sharper version of the same problem: they run via a bare `.invoke()` with no `RunnableConfig`/callbacks threaded through from the parent chain, so they never enter the traced execution graph at all — no runName would ever make them appear in `chain.streamEvents()`. Their prompt/completion is instead captured directly as plain data inside `scoreRelevance`/`scoreCandidates` (via `rerankTemplate.format()` for the prompt) and carried out as extra fields (`prompt`, `completion`) on each `ScoredCandidate` row, rendered as a per-row expandable disclosure in `RagPipelineVisualizer.tsx`'s score table — a different mechanism from the single `llm: {prompt, completion}` field used for the other LLM stages. The frontend's `RagPipelineVisualizer` component (`src/app/components/RagPipelineVisualizer.tsx`) renders `RAG_PIPELINE_STAGES[mode]` as a step-by-step diagram — pending/active/done per stage, with a collapsed-by-default "Show raw LLM prompt & response" disclosure per LLM stage — fed either by this live `stage` stream (mounted persistently above the message list, so any mode's pipeline is browsable before a question is even sent) or, per assistant message, by that message's frozen `pipelineTrace` (captured in `home/page.tsx`'s SSE loop the same way `sources` is) behind a "How this answer was generated" toggle.

The LLM is prompted (`answerTemplate` in `prompts.ts`) to cite chunks inline as `[Source N]`; the client turns those into clickable markdown links (`linkifyCitations` in `home/page.tsx`) that look up that source's `pageNumber` and jump the embedded PDF viewer straight to it. Each assistant message also renders a row of "Page N" chips (deduped from its `sources`) as a citation-free fallback way to jump pages. The PDF itself is rendered via a plain `<iframe src="<blob-url>#page=N">` — no `react-pdf`/pdfjs — so it stays embedded and visible the whole time ("always open") and the browser's own PDF viewer supplies zoom/search/print/manual scroll for free. Because `<iframe>` can't send the `User-Id` auth header, the client still fetches the file with `fetch()` first and turns the response into an object URL, exactly like the pre-citation-era implementation did.

### Document ingestion flow (`/api/document`)

`POST` — uploads the raw PDF to a Supabase Storage bucket (`document_store`, keyed by `${userId}.${ext}`, one file per user, `upsert: true`), parses it with `PDFLoader`, splits it with `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` (1000/100 chunk size/overlap), tags each chunk with `{documentName, pageNumber, userId}` metadata, deletes that user's previous embeddings (`delete_documents_by_user` RPC) before writing new ones, then embeds and stores via `vectorStore().addDocuments`.

`GET` — looks up the current user's stored file by name prefix and streams it back; the client wraps it in an object URL for the embedded `<iframe>` PDF viewer.

Because storage/retrieval is scoped by `userId` header (not real auth), each user effectively has exactly one active document at a time.

### Auth model — important gotcha

Login/signup (`/api/login`, `/api/signup`) hit Supabase RPCs (`verify_password`, raw `insert` into `users`) directly with **no session/JWT issued**. The client (`src/app/page.tsx`) just stores the plaintext `username` in `sessionStorage.userId` on success and sends it back as the `User-Id` header on every subsequent `/api/chat` and `/api/document` request — that header is the sole "auth" boundary and is trivially spoofable. `jose` and `@types/jsonwebtoken` are in `package.json` but are not currently wired into any route — don't assume JWT-based auth exists when reading or modifying auth code.

### Key files

- `src/app/lib/ollama.ts` — constructs the shared `ChatOllama` (`llm`) and `OllamaEmbeddings` (`embeddings`) singletons used everywhere.
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` — builds a `CallbackHandler` (`@langfuse/langchain`) per request, gets a plain `RunnableSequence` from `buildRagChain`, and drives it with `.streamEvents()` to produce the `sources`/`token`/`done` SSE response described above. When `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` is absent the callbacks array is empty and tracing is skipped.
- `src/instrumentation.ts` — Next.js instrumentation hook; creates a `NodeTracerProvider` with `LangfuseSpanProcessor` and wires it via `setLangfuseTracerProvider` (`@langfuse/tracing`). Uses an isolated provider rather than `NodeSDK`/`provider.register()` because Next.js claims the global OTel provider first.
- `src/app/lib/supabase.ts` — `supabaseClient` (auth/storage/RPC) and `vectorStore(filter)` / `retriever(filter)` factories for the `documents` table.
- `src/app/lib/rag-strategies/` — the `RagMode` registry and chain compositions described above (`index.ts`, `modes.ts`, `condense.ts`, `naive.ts`, `retrieval.ts`, `pipeline-metadata.ts` for the visualizer's per-mode stage list/copy).
- `src/app/components/RagPipelineVisualizer.tsx` — the step-by-step pipeline diagram component (live or frozen-per-message), see "Pipeline visualizer" above.
- `src/app/lib/prompts.ts` — all prompt templates.
- `src/app/utils/env.ts` — single source of truth for env var access.
- `src/app/utils/helpers.ts` — `buildContext(retrievedDocs)`, which numbers chunks into a `[Source N | Page P]`-prefixed context string for the LLM plus a parallel `{id, pageNumber}` sources array for the client (the sole place chunk metadata is preserved instead of discarded).
- `src/app/home/page.tsx` — main chat + Document UI, responsive (stacked/tabbed below `md`, side-by-side at `md`+). Renders assistant responses via `marked` with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, parses the `/api/chat` SSE stream event-by-event into state, and keeps the uploaded PDF permanently embedded in an `<iframe>` that inline `[Source N]` citations (and per-message "Page N" chips) jump to the right page.
- `supabaseScripts.txt` — the SQL schema/RPCs this app depends on; not run automatically, must be applied manually to a new Supabase project.

## Definition of done
Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` — both must pass before any change is complete.
There is no test suite; manually verify affected routes in the running dev server.

## Supabase scripts

`supabaseScripts.txt` is the source of truth for the Supabase schema and RPCs. **Always keep it in sync**: any time you add, modify, or remove a table, column, function, trigger, or extension, update `supabaseScripts.txt` to reflect the change before considering the task done.

## Guardrails — never do this
- NEVER change the vector dimension from 768 without also updating the `documents` table
  column and the `match_documents` RPC in Supabase — a mismatch silently breaks retrieval.
- NEVER add application-level password hashing — the Supabase `before_insert_or_update`
  trigger handles it via pgcrypto. Adding it in code will double-hash and break login.
- The `User-Id` header is NOT verified auth — it is trivially spoofable. Never treat it
  as a security boundary; always be explicit that this is the current limitation.
- Always add new env vars through `src/app/utils/env.ts` — never call `process.env`
  directly elsewhere in the codebase.
- Keep `src/app/lib/rag-strategies/*` (`condense.ts`, `naive.ts`, and any new strategy)
  as plain LangChain runnable compositions (`RunnableSequence`/`RunnableLambda`/prompt
  templates piped together) — this was a deliberate cleanup, not an oversight. Don't
  reintroduce hand-rolled `async (input) => {...}` orchestration in a strategy file to
  extract `sources` early; instead give the relevant step a `runName` via `.withConfig()`
  (see `retrieval.ts`'s `retrieveAndBuildContext` and `condense.ts`/`naive.ts`'s
  `answerLLM`) and read it out in `api/chat/route.ts` via `chain.streamEvents()`.
